## The project's overview

Individual Project 1 gives a focus on front-end web development for the purpose of building a personal web development for career purposes. After completing this project, I've had a newfound acknowledgement of the difficulty that goes into developing a webpage, how to make every component in a webpage present well and implementing programming to turn the website into something more dynamic than what I expected.  

Deployed website on github.io: [https://tranmk.github.io/index.html](https://tranmk.github.io/index.html)

All code and documents used for this lab is available in [https://github.com/TranMK/TranMK.github.io](https://github.com/TranMK/TranMK.github.io).  

## General Requirements (30 pts)

I created a deployable website for my github page by naming the repo "TranMK.github.io", then added two files, index.html(main site) and waph.html(WAPH course-specific site). By doing [https://tranmk.github.io/index.html](https://tranmk.github.io/index.html) or [https://tranmk.github.io/waph.html](https://tranmk.github.io/waph.html), I can display those two files on my browser.  

## Non-technical requirements (20 pts)

I used Bootstrap framework to implement a theme for my index.html display. The original theme used for my website is (https://startbootstrap.com/theme/agency)[https://startbootstrap.com/theme/agency]. I also implemented a page tracker by detecting the country the IP accessing the site.
